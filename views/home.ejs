            <h1>FRC Team 3006, Red Rock Robotics</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the website of FIRST Robotics Competition team #3006, Red Rock Robotics. We are a roughly 30 member team based out of Salt Lake City, Utah 
               and are currently in our tenth competition season.</p> 
            <p>Last season was quite exciting for our team. We competed at both the Utah and Idaho regionals, advancing past alliance selections 
               at both competitions. Our alliance won in Idaho, sending us to the World Championship in Houston, Texas. In addition, we were given the Industrial 
               Design Award for our robot's durability, especially in electronic component design.</p>
            <p>Even more stuff</p>
